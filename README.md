Package gotest provides rich assertions for use within and beyond Go's `testing` package.

GoTest plays well with "vernacular" Go `testing` tests, providing a rich set of assertions to test HTTP Responses, JSON and JSON:API data, general equality, numeric comparison, collections, strings, panics, types, and time.

See the [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/kindrid/gotest).
